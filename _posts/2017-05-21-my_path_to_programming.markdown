title:  MY PATH TO PROGRAMMING

My background is a bit unconventional; I walked-on before eventually earning a scholarship and starting for the University of Iowa football team.  My passion for sports and leadership led me to several coaching positions at both the University of Iowa and overseas.  I spent five years as a Defensive Schemes Coordinator and Head Coach in Italy and Switzerland.  The experiences were enriching as well as challenging; I am honored to say that I designed and implemented defensive structures and schemes for four nationally top-rated defenses. The result was one Swiss National Championship and three-time National Runner-Ups.

After completing my coaching contract, I decided to launch a company focused on alleviating pain points I felt as both an athlete and a coach. I was fortunate enough to apply and be admitted into the Startup Chile accelerator in 2015.  Eventually, operations were brought to Des Moines, Iowa.  The original codebase was developed in AngularJS via contract workers overseas.  While initial traction was positive (8,000 users within 10 weeks of launch), the cadence for development was negatively impacting growth.  I made the decision to become more hands on with the development process.  This was my first experience coding.  I was in charge of the front-end of the application; many hours were spent reading Stack Overflow and other resources to learn quickly and ensure our deadlines were met.  In addition to coding, as CEO I have been in charge of all marketing, support, and operational work. 

I started learning development out of necessity, but it was clear within the first couple of days that it was something I truly enjoyed.  I have taken on several freelance Ruby on Rails web development projects in which I’ve designed and coded the front-end and back-end. 

The two things that drive me are learning new things and building great experiences.  I feel becoming a programmer aligns well with my personal drivers. While I consider my back end programming skills to be “beginner” level at this point, I’m actively pursuing increased proficiency with Ruby on Rails and Javascript.  I will never be done with self improvement.
